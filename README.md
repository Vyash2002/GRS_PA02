## Course Information
### Course: Graduate Systems (CSE638)
### Assignment: Programming Assignment 02 (PA02)
### Topic: Analysis of Network I/O primitives using perf

# Objective

The objective of this assignment is to experimentally study the cost of data movement in network I/O by implementing and comparing:

  A1: Two-copy socket communication (baseline)

  A2: One-copy optimized socket communication

  A3: Zero-copy socket communication

The comparison is performed using application-level measurements and OS-level profiling via the Linux perf tool.
